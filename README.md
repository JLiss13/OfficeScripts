# OfficeScripts
Useful office scripts that will exponentially improve your workflow production with codes to read scanned documents, automate document organization and create files with document metadata.

Now that you have the my OfficeScripts repo to use any of the functions (For example: "ReadTIFFs_DPI600") in here you need many dependencies. The dependencies are:

PIL
pytesser
numpy
opencv
matplotlib
pyPdf

Once you have properly downloaded these libraries you can begin to use my office scripts to make your office life that much easier. I know these are a lot of libraries to install, but its worth it. Pay most attention when installing pytesser, opencv, pyPDF and PIL. Make sure not a single error appears or else the script will not work.
